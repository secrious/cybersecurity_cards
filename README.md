# Cybersecurity Cards

The deck of Cybersecurity Cards aims to provide introductory cybersecurity knowledge that supports learning and discussion, using [CyBOK v1.1](https://www.cybok.org/knowledgebase1_1/) as the foundation for the technical content. The design principles and evaluation of the cards are presented in the _Introducing and Interfacing with Cybersecurity - A Cards Approach_ paper [[1]](#1).

The cards we designed and evaluated as part of the [Secrious](https://secrious.github.io/) research project (EPSRC [EP/T017511/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T017511/1)).

## Versions

The latest version of the cybersecurity cards is Version 2 (`version_2`). The previous version is available (`version_1`).

The `version_2` directory contains one pdf with the full deck of cybersecurity cards (`version_2/CybersecurityCardsV2-Full-Deck.pdf`), one pdf of the glossary accompanying the cards (`version_2/CybersecurityCardsV2-Glossary.pdf`), and one pdf file per card (`version_2/CybersecurityCardV2-*.pdf`).
